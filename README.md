📘 Arbitrary Precision Calculator (C Project)

The Arbitrary Precision Calculator is a command-line tool written in C that performs arithmetic on very large integers—beyond the limits of standard data types like int, long, or long long.
It uses a Doubly Linked List to store each digit and manually implements arithmetic operations.

🚀 Features

➕ Addition of large numbers
➖ Subtraction with full borrow handling
✖️ Multiplication using partial product accumulation
➗ Division using repeated subtraction and comparison
✔️ Supports numbers of any length (no overflow)
✔️ Custom validation for operands & operators
✔️ Clean modular structure (separate .c and .h files)
